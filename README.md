### About Me

- 👋  Hi, I’m @daniel-arnjunckes <Daniel Arnoldo Junckes or DAJ>
- 🍺  I'm a SRE on AmbevTech
- 👀  I’m interested in the DevOps Culture, SRE stuffs and Automations
- 💻  I like to create little projects, where I can  learn and test new things
- 📌  I come here time to time to write some scripts as well, that make my life easier doing the boring stuff for me.
- 🐞  Wherever I see a toil, I like to automatize the process to remove it.
